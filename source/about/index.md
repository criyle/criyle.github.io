#### Q: What is this blog?

It is just a small place that I will write something about my life and techniques. `Lonely World` just inherited the name of the blog that I maintained when I was in my high school. I have not decided which Hexo theme to use, so this blog should looks different over times.

This blog will be updated at will, when I have done something interesting or I found something interesting.

#### Q: What is this name?

It was pick up from a range of random strings that I generated when I was in my high school. I assume that `criyle` have no special meaning.
