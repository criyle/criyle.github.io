I am a first year master student studying computer science, and my research interest is in natural language processing and large language models. 

I have developed [go-judge](https://github.com/criyle/go-judge) and [go-sandbox](https://github.com/criyle/go-sandbox) that supports multiple online judges for computer science education. Also, I participated the development of online judges including [Hydro](https://github.com/hydro-dev/Hydro) and [Universal Online Judge](https://github.com/vfleaking/uoj).

#### Intro

It is just a small place that I will write something about techniques and my life. `Lonely World` just inherited the name of the blog that I maintained when I was in my high school. I have not decided which `Hexo` theme to use, so this blog may look different over times.

This blog will be updated at will, when I have done something interesting, or I found something interesting.

#### About my ID

It was picked up from a range of random strings that I generated when I was in my high school. I assume that `criyle` have no special meaning.
